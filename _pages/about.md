I am a Robotics [Ph.D. Student](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/mononito-goswami/) at the [Auton Lab](https://www.autonlab.org/) in School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). My research focuses on leveraging weak supervision and domain knowledge from experts to affordably annotate large datasets. Ultimately, I expect my research to make the process of acquiring training data cost-efficient, less subjective, reliable yet grounded in domain expert intuition, to harness the power of modern Machine Learning to fuel advances in data-driven decision support. 

I was an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the Summer of 2022 and 2023!

Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my bachelor's in computer engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) (erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering) in India.

Feel free to drop me an email at mgoswami [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu if you are interested in my research and would like to collaborate! 

I am a member of the Robotics Institute Climate Committee, so if you're an RI student facing issues, let's chat!

My CV can be found [here](../CV_Mononito_Goswami.pdf).
