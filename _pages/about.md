I am a Robotics [Ph.D. Student](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/mononito-goswami/) at the [Auton Lab](https://www.autonlab.org/) in School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). I am interested in building foundation models for time series and tabular data. I am also interested in questions around data to (pre-)train machine learning model and also questions around model evaluation. I am excited about applications of ML to healthcare. 

I'm currently a Student Researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/). Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the summer of 2022 and 2023.

Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my bachelor's in computer engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) (erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering) in India.

Feel free to drop me an email at mgoswami [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu if you are interested in my research and would like to collaborate! 

My CV can be found [here](../CV_Mononito_Goswami.pdf).
