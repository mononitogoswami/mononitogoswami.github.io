I am a Robotics [Ph.D. Student](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/mononito-goswami/) at the [Auton Lab](https://www.autonlab.org/) in School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). 

I am interested in machine learning using imperfect data with an emphasis on healthcare and time-series modeling. Specifically, my research focusses on settings which challenge common assumptions on data, i.e., data is (1) labeled accurately, (2) centrally located, (3) sufficient to train complex models from scratch. I am also interested in evaluating trained machine learning models comprehensively in these practical settings, and foundation modeling for temporal data and clinical applications. 

I was an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the summer of 2022 and 2023! I'll be interning at [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai) this summer!

Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my bachelor's in computer engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) (erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering) in India.

Feel free to drop me an email at mgoswami [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu if you are interested in my research and would like to collaborate! 

I am a member of the Robotics Institute Climate Committee, so if you're an RI student facing issues, let's chat!

My CV can be found [here](../CV_Mononito_Goswami.pdf).

Time-series Foundation Models
------
I worked on MOMENT, the **first family of open-source large pre-trained time-series models**! MOMENT serves as a building block for **multiple time-series analysis tasks** (forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation, etc.), is effective **out-of-the-box**, i.e. with no (or few) particular task-specific exemplars (enabling zero-shot forecasting, etc.), and (3) is **tunable** using in-distribution and task-specific data to improve performance! Check out our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03885.pdf) and code on [anomymous github](anonymous.4open.science/r/BETT-773F/).

We are currently working on open-sourcing MOMENT, which includes EVERYTHING from the code to compile the Time-series Pile, pre-train, and fine-tune MOMENT, to the pre-trained model weights! If you're interested in our model, or have any questions or feature requests, please fill this [Google form](https://forms.gle/4MCFVHTHHzQqfvEd9), and we'll do our best to answer your questions, and update you as we open-source MOMENT and its subsequent improvements.
